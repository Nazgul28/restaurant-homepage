# Restaurant-homepage: RED Academy - Project2

It was my 2nd assignment at RED Academy (Web Development course).

It was an intersting project because I could practice more HTML5, CSS3 and I've also coded for the first time some JavaScript.

I've used media queries to make the website responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes.

In CSS3 I've used floatation again (as I did before in my 1st project - "Resume"), but I've also used Flexbox.

In JavaScript: 
a) I've implemented an image slider using a jQuery plugin (bx-slider -"carrousel"); 
b) I've dynamically displayed whether the restaurant is open or not (based on the day of the week—the restaurant is closed on Saturday and Sunday);
c) I've incorporated “smooth scrolling” into the menu that navigates to specific points in the page.
